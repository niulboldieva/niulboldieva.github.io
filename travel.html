          <h1>Travel</h1>

      <p>One of the best things about travel is undoubtedly the friendships and connections you make with people from across the globe. You might be surprised at just how close you can come to people within a matter of hours if you’re thrown together by circumstance in a country that is home to neither of you. Volunteer placements are a great way to establish firm friendships as you work towards a common goal, not only with other travelers, but also the local community. The interactions you’ll have will provide an incredible local insight into cultural traditions, beliefs and way of life on a communal level – something that you just can’t experience on TV or in a text book. Even if you live in a multicultural society and there are people of all beliefs and cultures living in your city, this is only scratching the surface of what is out there. Travel is a great way to immerse yourself in the cultural diversity that exists in our world. From festivals to food, weddings and funeral ceremonies, it’s mind blowing the unique ways different ethnic groups and tribes choose to celebrate life and the ancient customs that dictate everyday living.</p>

      <h1>Cappadocia</h1>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 side"><img src="https://t-ec.bstatic.com/xdata/images/hotel/max500/158492146.jpg?k=757e3952faa928eb18c55fc0e364ee370eccefb88d81c86d236715acacfb22e5&o=" style="width: 400px"></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><p>Sometimes weird can be truly beautiful. Cappadocia’s weird landscape is what makes it magical. Its strange beauty is unique and I doubt if you will ever see a place like this anywhere else on the planet. Perhaps Mother Nature was on LSD when she created Cappadocia.The correct way to describe Cappadocia’s landscape is actually “Moonscape” because it looks otherworldly. You may not ever get a chance to visit another planet, but a visit to Cappadocia will make you forget you’re on Earth.

Just look at this picture – how can this be real? (but it is!). As per me, this is truly magical.</p></div>

      <h1>Venice</h1>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 side"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Italy_Venice_Burano_Canal_001.jpg" style="width: 400px"></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><p>With its historic buildings and gorgeous canals, Venice is one of Italy’s most famous attractions. This floating city consists of a group of 117 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges. Some of the most photogenic places in Venice are on the outer islands. The small islands of Burano and Murano are not to be missed. I recommend spending the day island hopping and plan on having lunch on one of these islands. Fish lovers must try Gatto Nero on Burano.</p></div>

              <div class="col-md-4"><p>You cannot leave Milan without seeing the Duomo, the city’s imposing cathedral. The view from the roof is quite spectacular! Go shopping at the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the oldest shopping malls in the world.</p></div>

              <div class="col-md-4"><p>The French capital is one that has been drawing visitors for centuries.
