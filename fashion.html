      <div class="col-md-4"><p>As for exactly what it is that makes France’s premier film event so special, Izabel explains, “it’s the combination of being a pure celebration of film making, the heritage and beauty of the Cote d’Azur and of course the parties.” However, it’s not all play, as the secret to red carpet success is, Izabel reveals, all in the prep. “My Cannes routine always involves some kind of exercise, especially if I’ve come in from a different time zone—nothing beats jet lag better than a good work out. I’ll usually wake up super early and head off to the gym or do sprints to raise my heart rate—you have to squeeze it in first thing or else the day just takes over. When it comes to fashion choices, Izabel is a fan of throw-on chic. “I always opt for something new, simple and sexy. For me, it’s really important to keep things easy and not too fussy—you want to be as relaxed as possible so you can enjoy yourself.” Taking that attitude one step further, the 33-year old beauty was shot in a silk ankle-sweeping gown paired with embellished OAKLAND sneakers. <strong>"THE RED CARPET IS ALWAYS THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT—WELL UNLESS THERE’S A DANCE FLOOR WITH GOOD MUSIC"</strong></p></div>

      <p>The search for the perfect shoe can take a lifetime, especially as your needs and wants can change on a whim and with the seasons.

    And we’ve not even touched on a special occasion shoe either, say the perfect comfortable footwear to walk down the aisle or dance your first dance.

    But we may have found just what you’re looking for, especially if you’re a bride to be who is seeking comfort and a whole lot of glitter for your wedding day.

    The shoe masters at Jimmy Choo have unveiled the <a href="https://us.jimmychoo.com/en/diamond.html" target="_blank">Diamond</a> sneaker, a trainer reportedly encrusted with 4,546 Swarovski crystals atop a clear crystal-like sole with silver laces, of course, that tie the whole look together.</p>
