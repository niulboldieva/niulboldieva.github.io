<h1>Nurgie's Page</h1>


<p>My name is Nurgul and I grew up in Russia. My family are Turkish. At the age of 20 I moved to US to learn languages. While I was studying at Webber International University, I received an offer to work  at Fashion Industry . I spent four years working for Jimmy Choo in Orlando. After moving to New York in August I decided to learn computer languages. Currently I am studying in NYCDA.</p>

<p>Orlando is my second home town after Russia. I lived in Orlando 8 years and met amazing people who became my best friends. My favorite part living in Orlando was going to Disney World every weekend or drive to beach for a day. My future life I see myself living in Orlando with my family.

<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<p>One of my absolute favorite things to do is ski. Every year, since I was about twelve years old, my family goes on a ski trip. The white snow and alluring slopes are quite refreshing. I love the feeling I get as I fly down the mountain. I hear my skis slide across the crisp snow, I feel the wind brushing along my cheeks and my adrenaline kicks in as I go faster and faster. It's an indescribable feeling that I love to experience.</p>
